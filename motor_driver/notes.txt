Note that there is no "reverse protection" on the Vcc connection,
and that this shortcoming will need to be handled with the appropriate
hardware. Considering the potential destruction of other circuit 
components if exposed to 12V it will be paramount to isolate Vcc. 
Use of a diode should be sufficient to prevent reverse current.

The following are a collection of thoughts, regarding circuit
design and schematic implementation

After reading datasheets this afternoon there are a few
notes that should be made, specific to some of the components.

The D24 voltage regulator has Pins power good (PG) and enable
(EN) which will be unecessary for our application. 

The S18 voltage regulator features a similar enable (EN) pin
as the D24, which too is unecessary. 

All TOF sensors, include unecessary VDD, GPIO0, and GPIO1 pins. 

The motor driver has two grounds on the motor output side of
the board, which could be wired in parallel.

The PCA9685 board features a number of unecessary feature pins.
Uncessary pins include: OE, and V+

In addition to uncecessary module features there are a number 
of outstanding questions:
1) Can GPIO voltage and ground pins be wired in parallel?
2) If we can wire gpio pins in parallel do we gain anything
by exploiting this configuration?
3) Where should we locate the diode(s) to prevent back 
polarity and current flow?
4)How do we wire PWM output? Which ground is necesary for the
PWM signal?

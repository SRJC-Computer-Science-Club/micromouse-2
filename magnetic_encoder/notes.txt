The following are a collection of notes collected through
experience working with the magnetic encoders, along with 
observations made when reading the datasheets.

After reviewing the electrical schematic provided by pololu
for the magnetic encoder board, I was concerned hall effect
sensors were wired in the same circuit as motor leads (M1 
and M2). The schematic indicates a common ground, but does 
not specify if the ground is unique to the logic components 
on the board. Fortunately, after viewing the PCB under 
magnification, along with testing voltages across the logic
while providing current to M1 and M2, I can confirm all 
logic leads (Vcc, Out: A and B, GND) are isolated from 
motor leads (M1 and M2).
Knowing motor and logic circuits are distinct implies there
is no need to isolate the logical components on the encoders.
Furthermore, there is no potential for reverse current or
polarity being sent back to the pi.
